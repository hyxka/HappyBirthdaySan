                        first off, im so grateful that you messaged me, complimenting my status. like who would have thought that a simple compliment will result in this absolutely chaotic friendship where we both are just deep-understanding-chaotic-peverted-helpfull people. it started with a simple "HAHAHA YOUR STATUS" and hopefully doesnt end at all.

                        Y o u ~

                    <p>
                        right of the bat, you are one of the most unique people that i have been friends with. like as soon as you messaged me, we never had that awkward phase of "heyy..". what im trying to say is, it was like a c o n n e c t i o n between us. i love talking to you. not only beucase its fun and exciting but also because you are like the same level of crack, pervertness and equally deep and perspective like me. its never a boring sight when talking to you. i enjoy talking to you so much pls.
